There are seven different functions to generate these samples of subsets:
1- Multiplication principle --> multiple sets (choose one of each)
2- Simple arrangements --> ordered subset with no rep
3- Arrangements with repetitions --> ordered substet with rep
4- Simple permutations --> reordering the set (ordered set without rep)
5- Permutations with repetitions --> reodering the set with repeting el. (ordered set with rep)
6- Simple combinations --> unordered subset without rep
7- Combinations with repetitions --> unordered subset with rep
(Note: there is no unordered set because it would be the set itself)
