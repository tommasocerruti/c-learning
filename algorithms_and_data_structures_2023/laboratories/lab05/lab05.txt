Exercise 01
-----------

Write a C program solving the "magic square" problem.

A "magic square" of size equal to n is a (n x n) matrix of
integers containing only integer numbers from 1 to (n x n),
such that the sum of those values on all rows, on all columns,
and on the two diagonals is the same.

The program has to receive two parameters on the command line:
* an integer value n
* a file name
and it has to store one magic square of size n on the file.

Example
-------

If we suppose to run the program with the following two parameters
3 square.txt
it has to store in the file the following matrix:

8 3 4
1 5 9
6 7 2

which includes all numbers from 1 to 9 (3x3) and satisfies the requested
criteria (all the above mentioned sums are equal to 15).



Exercise 02
-----------

The reflected binary code, also known as Gray code after Frank Gray,
is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only
one bit (binary digit). 

The code list for n bits can be generated recursively from the list
for nâˆ’1 bits by reflecting the list (i.e. listing the entries in
reverse order), concatenating the original list with the reversed
list, prefixing the entries in the original list with a binary 0, and
then prefixing the entries in the reflected list with a binary 1.

Example
-------

The two codes of length equal to 1 are made-up of one 0 and one 1:

  0
  1

To move from 1 to 2 bits, the list is firstly reflected (-- indicates
a mirror), and then 0s are added above and 1s below the reflection
point.

  0      0     00
  1      1     01
---    ---    ---
         1     11
         0     10

The process in then repeated to move from 2 to 3 bits (reflection and
then 0s and 1s addition):

 00     00    000 
 01     01    001 
 11     11    011 
 10     10    010 
---    ---    ---
        10    110 
        11    111 
        01    101 
        00    100 

Write a recursive program that:
- Receives n as a parameter
- Generates all Gray codes on n bits, and stores the codes in a dynamic
  matrix with n rows and 2^n columns
- Prints out the resulting matrix.
